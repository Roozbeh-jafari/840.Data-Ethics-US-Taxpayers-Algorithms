# 840.Data-Ethics-US-Taxpayers-Algorithms
Tax audits are a critical compliance tool to help ensure fairness in the tax system, and the IRS works hard to ensure the agency's audit selection process is fair and impartial. Decisions to conduct audits are based on the financial information that's on – or not on – the tax return. There's an extensive set of checks and balances to ensure fairness with individual audits, and there are important protections and appeals for taxpayers during the administrative process as well.

In this project we have dived into IRS audit algorithms and attempted to understand :
what factors lead to increased chance of being audited?
What demographic factors are associated with higher audit rates?
Is the algorithm fair in how it assigns audits?
